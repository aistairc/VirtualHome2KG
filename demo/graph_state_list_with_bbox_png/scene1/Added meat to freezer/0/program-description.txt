Added meat to freezer
After shopping for groceries, i returned home, i walked to the dining room and placed meat items in freezer located in the dining room. I opened up the bags from the grocery store, removed all the meat items, and after opening the freezer door, i placed the meat items into the freezer, and closed the door.
